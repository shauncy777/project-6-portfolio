Your project displays the appropriate number of students per page and the search provides feedback when no students were found. You have set up some solid logic and done a great job building a concise, yet effective, search! Excellent work implementing the keyup event listener, this really makes for a smooth search and adds a lot to the user experience. Nicely done!'",

Your naming conventions for variables and functions are extremely clear and meaningful. You've commented where needed, particularly above your function signatures and blocks of variable initialization. It was nice to see that your script wasn't flooded with comments, as some do, but you let your code do most of the talking, as it was legible enough to do so. Going for a projects exceeds can definitely lengthen a scripts length, and it's good practice to try to keep shorter applications, such as this, between maybe two-hundred to three-hundred lines. You did just that!!! This was done with pure elegance, and you should be absolutely proud of this accomplishment.'",
